    "The hawks.csv file contains body measurements including age, sex, wing, weight, bill length (culmen) and talon length (hallux) for a sample of hawks observed near Iowa City, Iowa. The data was collected by students and faculty at Cornell College over a 10-year period. There are three species represented in this dataset: Cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk. Using the csv file hawks.csv and scikit-learn's LinearDiscriminantAnalysis() function, construct a linear discriminant analysis model to classify a hawk's species based on the hawk's wing, weight, and culmen.\n",
